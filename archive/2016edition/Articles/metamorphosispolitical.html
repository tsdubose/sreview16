    <h2>Transcript</h2>
  <p>I hail from a developing nation that faces several socioeconomic challenges. From corruption to honor killing, India deals with multiple prevailing issues that affects every strata of the society. In my opinion, a country's future is shaped by the government's working efficiency and that is where my political beliefs are rooted. Ever since middle school, I was implicitly told that there are leaders who have dedicated their lives to make a better India and someday, their unrelenting efforts will bear fruit. However, I came to the realization that the power of change is not solely in the hands of politicians but it is also an equal responsibility of the citizens of the country.</p>
  <div class="accentText accentTextSmall col-xs-12">I used to perceive political campaigns to be plans of 'organized interests' through continuous inculcation and 'insinuation of untruths'.</div>
  
  <p>I used to perceive political campaigns to be plans of 'organized interests' through continuous inculcation and 'insinuation of untruths'. I witnessed the underlying greed for power and money that impelled these 'leaders' to make the common people believe that betterment is inevitable once that specific political party is in power. I witnessed political murders, bombings and several other aspects that brought about the firm belief that politics is a bane for society's advancements.</p>

  <p>It was only in high school when I started taking interest in current affairs that my belief gradually began to go through metamorphosis. Before I took a closer look at social behavior, I was a skeptic and a non-believer of political drama. I never realized the role of politics in a country's social structure, I failed to realize how the government is responsible for 'dividing the economy's pie'. I was living with the firm belief that the citizens had no responsibility of the nation's welfare and it was on the political leaders to accelerate the progress curve of the nation. When I looked closely at the economic challenges and religious obligations, I realized that it is the citizens who have the right to decide whether a law or policy is truly just, and they are in charge of voicing their unhappiness about it if it is not.</p>

  <p>My remodeled belief opines that a country's better future lies in collective effort of the common people where Adam Smith's theory of the 'invisible hand' actively works to establish social benefit through pursuit of individual interests. Politics aims to amalgamate opinions from different angles and devise the best policy for the country's population. In society, it is important for every individual to be elucidated about what they want from their government. The theory of the 'invisible hand' can only hold true when the citizens ask for their fundamental property rights. In order to attain an efficient governmental structure, there needs to be constant progress monitoring and evaluation both by the leaders and the people. Thus, the problem not only lies in the leaders who make politics a dirty game to climb up the ladder of personal favor and fame, but also the voters who do not challenge them and simply complain.</p>

  <p>I believe that politics makes the multitude feel empowered. I can safely say that once I am eligible to vote in the United States, I will play a significant part in politics by carefully choosing my leaders and taking part in awareness movements. For instance, I think an important agenda for the aspiring leaders in the 2016 presidential race should be installation of solar panels across the [United States] since it has the second largest carbon footprint right after China. On the other hand, India should focus more on controlling population and alleviating poverty and unemployment. In other words, government and political strategies differ nation to nation as the problems faced by them vary.</p>

  <p>The knowledge of current affairs and global aspirations have made me a politically decisive citizen, it has probed me to think critically, check premises and validate the truth of assertions. Today, I have the ability to form and explain opinions and be an active participant in meaningful discussions. I feel glad that I have had a change in belief and makes me hopeful for a generation that is politically conscious and involved despite imperfections and the government maximally efficient.</p>
