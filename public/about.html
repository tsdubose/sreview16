<p>I have always loved to write fiction and poetry. It’s always been like a safe haven for me. Growing up in Brooklyn then moving to Jersey has given me more opportunities. Some of my other passions are dancing and working with children. I plan on getting my Doctorate and having my own clinical practice in my later future.</p>

<p>I graduate next fall 2017 and will be teacher certified in fall 2018. I hope to have my own 4th or 5th grade classroom, but I’ll settle for middle school. I had a great experience managing the Scarlet Review, and learning to copy edit as well. Overall, working for the Scarlet Review has taught me a lot, and I’ve learned to manage a classroom like I managed the Scarlet Review.</p>
