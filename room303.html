Then, I walk through the doors and press the button for floor two.</p>
<p>I wait for the elevator to arrive at floor two, and when it does, I walk down the hallway. I say the numbers on each door out loud, 201 all the way to 250. When I reach the end of the hall, I walk back to the elevator and say all the numbers again, in reverse order. Then I go to floor three and recite all the numbers the same way, up and down. After that I count the doors on floors four, five, and six.</p><img class="accent-image" src="img/accent-image-room303.jpg">
<p>I do this every day after work. It makes me feel relaxed. The world is too unpredictable, but the numbers on the doors do not change.</p>
<hr>
<div class="accent-text">I stepped off the elevator, still covering my ears, and stood at the end of the hallway. The alarm wouldn’t stop. I wanted to recite the numbers on the doors, but I couldn’t focus on them.</div><p>Today, after I finished reciting the numbers for floor two, I boarded the elevator like always. But when I got to floor three, I heard a terrible, loud sound, like an explosion in a movie. I covered my ears and screamed. Then an alarm went off and a red light started flashing and I screamed even more.</p>
<p>I stepped off the elevator, still covering my ears, and stood at the end of the hallway. The alarm wouldn’t stop. I wanted to recite the numbers on the doors, but I couldn’t focus on them.</p>
<p>Sometimes when I get overwhelmed, I like to arrange things. Right now my bookshelf is alphabetized, but I put my favorite books on a separate pile next to my bed. <em>The Invention of Hugo Cabret, Living Independently,</em> and <em>Disney from A to Z.</em> Unfortunately, there is nothing to arrange in the hallway on the third floor of Jackson Street Apartments.</p>
<p>I realized that I would not be able to stop the alarm myself, so I would have to ask someone for help. I do not like talking to people because I never have enough time to figure out what I am going to say.</p>
<p>When I was little, Mom told me: “Preston, our true character is shown when we challenge ourselves.”</p>
<p>I do not particularly like challenges.</p>
<hr>
<p>I whispered “301” and knocked on the door. A woman cradling a baby in one arm and holding a phone in her hand answered it.</p>
<p>“Can you hold on a second?” she said. I don’t really understand why people say things like this, because a second is not a real thing, and you can’t hold it in your hand. She hung up the phone and turned to me.</p>
<p>“Do you need something?”</p>
<p>I had not thought about what I was going to say, so I said nothing.</p>
<p>“Are you – why are you staring at me? I asked you a question.”</p>
<p>I needed time to think, but she kept saying things.</p>
<p>“I really don’t have time for this – God, what the hell is that alarm?”</p>
<p>The baby in her arms started to cry.</p>
<p>“Are you going to say anything? What are you, retarded or something?”</p>
<p>She did not seem happy with me, so I walked away, and she slammed the door.</p>
<hr>
<p>I took a few steps, whispered “302,” and knocked on the next door in the hallway. This time, I had the words ready in my head.</p>
<p>“Hello there,” came the voice of another woman. She stood in the doorframe with a man next to her. I estimated that they were in their 40’s.</p>
<p>“Hello,” I said. “I am having trouble with the elevator.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, we were wondering what all that noise was about. Did you do that?”</p>
<p>“No – well, yes – well, sort of.”</p>
<p>They chuckled. The man grinned at me. “Well, why don’t we go down and take a look together?”</p>
<p>I had not anticipated this. I did not want to go back towards the noise, but they were already going that way. I decided to challenge myself and follow them.</p>
<p>As we got closer, the ringing in my ears got louder and louder and my head started to feel like it was bursting. I screamed to try to make my voice louder than the alarm, but it didn’t work. I ran the other way.</p>
<hr>
<p>After another moment I found myself in front of apartment 303. I whispered “303” and knocked on the door three times, really hard, like the undercover agents in spy shows who come to arrest the criminal. I didn’t want to look behind me to see the people from 302. I knew they would be staring at me.</p>
<p>“What’s this? Bunch of ruckus out here today,” came a deep, old-sounding voice.</p>
<p>“Please let me in,” I said.</p>
<p>“Well, ain’t that forward of you. All right, then, come in.”</p>
<p>He opened the door, and I slammed it behind me.</p>
<p>“Jeez, calm down there, son. What’s the matter? You being chased by someone?”</p>
<p>I sighed and sat down on his soft, white carpet, then glanced up. He had on a tweed jacket and a red Mets baseball cap. Much older than his neighbors.</p>
<p>“You remind me of someone.” He looked at me carefully. “Yeah. Joe Wilkinson. Every little thing set him off.”</p>
<p>I was still breathing heavily. “Can you – help me – with – the noise?”</p>
<p>He raised his left eyebrow.</p>
<p>“Out – side.”</p>
<p>“Come on, now, son. Deep breaths. In and out. Whatever’s out there ain’t as bad as you might think.”</p>
<p>“El – ev – ator.”</p>
<p>“Come again?”</p>
<p>“Elevator.” I did it all in one breath this time.</p>
<p>“Ah. That old garbage heap. Wish I could help you, but you’re gonna have to find someone else.”</p>
<p>He was about to show me the way out, but I had seen the toolbox sitting on his bedside table.</p>
<p>“Tools,” I said.</p>
<p>He blinked. “Oh, yeah. My buddy lent those to me. Gotta get those back to him. When you get to be my age, things all start to mush together. I wish you luck. Why don’t you grab yourself a candy there on the way out.”</p>
<p>“They are your tools,” I said, my voice shaking a bit. I was more comfortable talking with him because he spoke slowly, but I still could not look him right in the eye.</p>
<p>“I – well.” He glanced over at a picture on the wall, an old framed advertisement that had a picture of him holding up a hammer. “Fine, you caught me. But I tell you what. You shouldn’t force people into things. You gotta be careful.”</p>
<p>My head still felt like it would burst.</p>
<hr>
<p>He sighed, then reached up in his ears and adjusted his hearing aids. “You’re throwing me into the trenches here, kid.” He grabbed the toolbox and marched out the door. I peered out, but didn’t follow him.</p>
<p>“Well, come on! You can’t just stay over there.”</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>“Plug your ears. Do what you have to do. But it ain’t gonna happen if you don’t do anything, and I ain’t going unless you’re coming with me.”</p>
<p>I plugged my ears, still shaking, and took a few steps toward him. We both stepped into the elevator. The noise was not so bad now that my brain was less frightened.</p>
<p>The old man squinted and adjusted his cap. He used a screwdriver to open up a small panel and poke at the wires. As he dropped tools on the floor, I arranged them by size. After a few minutes, he grunted and crossed his arms.</p>
<p>“Why even bother? I can’t do this anymore.”</p>
<p>“I think you can do it,” I said.</p>
<p>“Now why’s that?”</p>
<p>“I have had to face many challenges today. And this is another challenge.”</p>
<p>He raised his eyebrows. “What? What kind of challenges?”</p>
<p>“I could not count all the doors today like I’m used to. I had to do the numbers out of order. Then I had to knock on doors and talk to people.”</p>
<p>He laughed out loud. “Are you kidding? You – you’re joking, right?”</p>
<p>“No. I am telling the truth.”</p>
<p>His expression became more serious. “You think those are challenges? I’ll tell you what’s a challenge, kid. Staying alive, that’s a challenge. Seeing your friends die in front of you, that’s a challenge. Watching Joe Wilkinson quiver in fear underneath a corpse and not being able to say anything or do anything, that’s a damn challenge. Don’t kid around with me. Your life ain’t that hard.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t say it was or was not.”</p>
<hr>
<p>We stood there and said nothing while the noise continued.</p>
<p>“Well, I gave it my best shot. Good luck with your routine.”</p>
<p>As he got up, he glanced down at the panel one last time. Suddenly, he looked very excited.</p>
<p>“Hmm. That’s gotta be it. Oh – ah-hah!”</p>
<p>He grabbed a pair of pliers from his toolbox and snipped a red wire. The noise stopped and the red light did not flash anymore.</p>
<p>“Well, look at that, kid. I got your elevator fixed.”</p>
<p>“It just took a little time.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you’re right. It’s just hard to focus sometimes when your head’s full of – well, full of stuff.”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>He grabbed his toolbox and stepped out of the doors. “It ain’t gonna run for a while, kid. You’re gonna have to get someone else to help you with that.”</p>
<p>“It’s OK. Thank you.”</p>
<p>“Good luck.”</p>
<p>He went back to room 303 and shut the door behind him.</p>
<p>I stepped outside the elevator. I started at room 304 because I had already recited three rooms. I read out numbers 304 through 350, then I took the stairs to floor four, and I didn’t really mind.</p>
